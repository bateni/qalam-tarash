# Qalam-tarash (قلم‌تراش)
A font build system including scripts and Makefile

This is based on Khaled Hosny's build scripts, in paritcular the [Mada](https://github.com/alif-type/mada) font.  The scripts in the `tools` directory may be used on their own.  The provided `Makefile` is just an example for building Saber Rastikerdar's [Sahel font](https://github.com/rastikerdar/sahel-font).

See `INSTALL.md` for some of the required packages.
